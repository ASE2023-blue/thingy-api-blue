# thingy-api - Park'N'Share

## Introduction
We are Team blue, a team of four people: Werner Schmid, Aimen Fahmi, Gobi Ahonon, and Marco De Liso. We worked on the web application Park'N'Share for the university project at the lecture Advanced Software Engineering.

The web application Park'N'Share is divided into two main repositories, thingy-api repository is responsible for the whole backend of the application, whereas the thingy-client repository is responsible for the entire frontend of the web application.

## How To Run the Project

It is straightforward to run the application, you can follow the instructions given below to run the application on your local host at `http://localhost:3001/` or you can also directly access our webpage from the browser at the link `https://656f802f25a57c30c1e0bc2e--fascinating-froyo-772267.netlify.app/` because we deployed the application on Azure cloud provider since we dockerized it.

### Install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Run in dev mode

```
npm run start:dev
```

### Run in prod mode

```
npm run start:prod
```

## Limitations and important notes
The application makes a large use of third-party services, therefore, many different functionalities highly depend on tokens to work properly or other configurations that are private. Therefore, since we are not willing to share passwords and personal tokens, to test the full application you will need our presence so that we can show you directly.

Depending on the OS you are using, starting the application may not work with certain configurations.
